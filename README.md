# Sorting Visualization

## Purpose
  This project's purpose was to help me understand how to implement sorting algorithms and how
  sorting algorithms handle data in real time.
  
  This project has also been used to demonstrate sorting algorithms in Algirithm Tutorials for IIIT Lucknow Freshman.

## Features
  This project features many sorts including:

  Basic Sorts:
  - Bubble sort
  - Insertion sort
  - Selection sort
  - Merge sort

  Advanced Sorts:
  - Gnome Sort
  - Shell Sort
  - Radix Sort

  You are able to change the speed at which the sorts operate as well as the size of the data set.

### Usage in Algorithm Tutorials
  This visualizer was used to introduce college freshman to sorting algorithms in their competitive programming lectures, by showing them the procedural flow of these algorithms.
  (Acted as a TA for the same.)
